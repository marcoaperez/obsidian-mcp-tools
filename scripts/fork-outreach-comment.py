"""Historical outreach script — archives cross-project issue pointers.

NOTE: This script was used during the 0.3.x era to post "fixed here" pointers
on issues in the predecessor repository. It is retained as a historical
reference and audit log companion (scripts/.outreach-log.jsonl). The outreach
campaign is complete; do not run --execute against REPO_UPSTREAM again.

Posts a standardized pointer comment on every listed issue, one comment per
issue, via `gh issue comment`. Tracks what has been commented in
scripts/.outreach-log.jsonl so re-runs are idempotent.

Defaults to --dry-run (prints what would be sent, sends nothing). Pass
--execute to actually post. Intended workflow:

    # 1. Review the list and the rendered comments:
    python3 scripts/fork-outreach-comment.py

    # 2. If satisfied, post them:
    python3 scripts/fork-outreach-comment.py --execute

    # 3. Re-running after --execute is safe: already-commented issues are
    #    skipped. Use --force to override.

The mapping issue → (commit, version) is maintained inline below. When a
new release lands, update FORK_FIX_MAP accordingly (source of truth:
CHANGELOG.md).
